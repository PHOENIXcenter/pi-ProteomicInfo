π-ProteomicInfo
Introduction
π-ProteomicInfo is an automated workflow designed for proteomics data processing. It consists of three main modules: SearchServer, SearchClient, and sendInfo. The entire workflow covers data transmission from the data acquisition computer to the database search computer, extracting file information based on database search results, quality control of mass spectrometry files, and sending the results of quality control.
π-ProteomicInfo 是一个用于蛋白质组学数据处理的自动化工作流程，包含三个主要模块：SearchServer、SearchClient 和 sendInfo。整个工作流程涵盖从数据采集计算机到数据库搜索计算机的数据传输、基于数据库搜索结果提取文件信息、质谱文件的质量控制以及发送质量控制结果。
Installation and Usage
Executable Files
The files under the Exe tag are pre-packaged executable files. Users can simply extract and install the SearchServer, SearchClient, and sendInfoUI clients on the database search computer, data acquisition computer, and networked public computer, respectively, to use the basic functions. For additional module functions in SearchServer, please refer to the software prompts and place the corresponding files in the designated folders after extraction.
Exe 标签下的文件为封装好的可执行文件。用户分别在搜库电脑、质谱文件采集电脑、联网公共电脑安装 SearchServer、SearchClient 与 sendInfoUI 客户端即可使用基本功能。对于 SearchServer 的其他模块功能，请参照软件提示，解压后将对应的文件放置到指定文件夹中即可使用。
Source Code
The files under the Code tag are the source codes for the corresponding modules. Users can customize and modify the code based on their needs. Note that the code is intended for academic use only. For commercial use, please contact the relevant institution for authorization.
Code 标签为对应模块的源代码，用户可以基于源代码自定义修改。请注意，代码仅适用于学术范围，商业化使用请联系单位授权后方可使用。
